## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-02 — find_rules works with the Rust core + safe concurrent asset installs

### Fixed
- **`find_rules` now mines natively on the Rust core.** With `_core` attached (any engine from
  `load()` / `from_config()`), the fork-based Python pool mined **0 rules**: the workers mutate
  Python-side rule state while `simplify` runs on the immutable core — the same class of bug as the
  0.4.0 `prune_redundant_rules` fix. Phase 2 now delegates to the native mine when the core is
  attached (candidate library + per-length `mine_one_length` + `set_rules` between lengths,
  rayon-parallel; cap with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`; `n_workers` only applies to the pure-Python
  fallback). Mined rules are now always canonicalized to the wildcard (`_j`) form.
- **`find_rules(X=<ndarray>)`** no longer raises `NameError` (the documented array form was never
  assigned to the internal data variable).
- **Concurrent cold-cache asset installs are now safe.** Installs serialize per asset via a
  `FileLock`, and an asset only counts as installed when **every** file in its manifest is present,
  so a partially-downloaded asset is correctly treated as not installed. New dependency: `filelock`.

### Changed
- Offline-mining research artifacts (the Phase-B plan, the capability-gap analysis, and the mine
  grid/validation drivers) moved out of the released repo into the research archive.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-01 — native offline rule-miner + simplify fixes + CLI fix

### Added
- **Native (Rust-core) offline rule mining.** An all-cores native mine driver (with a grid timing
  harness) supersedes the pure-Python `find_rules` for offline discovery against the Rust `_core`.
- **Closed-form `pow(C, x)` / `pow(x, C)` log-linearization** in the offline pipeline.

### Fixed
- **`sort_operands` is now idempotent** — canonical operand order is a fixpoint (rotation iterated to
  convergence; mask-before-sort), so simplifying a simplified expression no longer changes it. This can
  change the canonical operand ordering of some expressions vs 0.3.x (verified not to affect the
  downstream symbolic-data / flash-ansr / srbf test goldens).
- **`prune_redundant_rules` corrected against the Rust core** (the pure-Python prune produced 0 rules
  with `_core`); offline grid mining caps sources at length ≤ i and chunks the per-config budget.
- **`simplipy install <name>` / `simplipy remove <name>` now work.** They previously passed the asset
  *type* as the asset name (and the name as `force`/`quiet`), so every invocation raised
  `ValueError: Unknown asset: 'engine'`. They now take just an asset name with clean error handling
  (message + exit 1, no traceback); the vestigial `--type` flag is dropped from `install`/`remove`
  (`list` keeps it).

### Docs
- Documented the normalization helpers in the API reference; added a CLI reference for
  `list` / `prune-rules` / `resolve-rules` / `install` / `remove`; qualified `SimpliPyEngine`
  methods in the component overview; named `symbolic-data` as the direct downstream in the family DAG.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-06-28 — expression-token normalization helpers

Adds pure-Python `normalize_skeleton`, `normalize_expression`, and `normalize_variable_token`
to the package root (also available as `simplipy.normalization`). These canonicalize a prefix
token sequence -- variable tokens (`v1`/`x1`, case-insensitive) to a stable `x{n}`, and numeric
literals to a `<constant>` placeholder (skeleton form) or kept as-is (expression form) -- so two
expressions that are "the same" up to variable renaming / constant values compare equal.

Relocated from flash-ansr (behavior-identical) so the canonicalizer lives at the shared
expression-engine leaf that downstream packages (symbolic-data, flash-ansr, srbf) all depend on,
keeping holdout-matching and symbolic-recovery scoring consistent by construction. No change to
the Rust inline backend (`simplipy._core`) or any existing API; purely additive.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-21 — Rust inline backend + the "numeric" engine line (MAJOR behavior change)

This release rewrites SimpliPy's **inline phase** (`simplify`, the prefix/infix conversions, and
validation) as a compiled Rust extension (`simplipy._core`) and makes the improved **numeric** engine
line the default. The **offline phase** (rule mining + `curve_fit`) stays pure Python.

### ⚠ Breaking — behavior changes vs 0.2.x

The default `simplify`/conversion behavior is now the corrected ("numeric") line. The engine-id is
**unchanged** (`dev_7-3` still identifies the rule-mining parameters: max source length 7, max target
length 3; the `rules.json` asset is byte-identical). What changed is the engine **code**:

1. **Numeric constant folding** is now applied during simplification. All-numeric subtrees evaluate to
   their `f64` result (e.g. `1/0 → float("inf")`, `sqrt(-1) → float("nan")`); the folding fires as a
   fallback after rule matching, so a rule that applies to an all-`<constant>` subtree is tried before
   the subtree is collapsed.
2. **Six conversion bug fixes**, most notably:
   a fractional-power child (`pow1_M`) is no longer silently dropped by `convert_expression`; left/right
   associativity in `infix_to_prefix`/`prefix_to_infix` is corrected (and round-trip-preserving);
   `x**0`, `--5`, `^`-vs-`**` unary-minus, and raw `powN` are handled correctly.
3. **`float("inf")` / `float("-inf")` / `float("nan")` are atomic tokens** in the conversion tokenizer,
   so a folded constant round-trips through prefix↔infix instead of fragmenting.

> Reproducibility: to reproduce results generated with the pre-0.3 engine (e.g. models trained against
> `dev_7-3` under SimpliPy 0.2.x), pin `simplipy<0.3`. The 0.2.x behavior is the frozen anchor; 0.3 is a
> deliberate, documented quality improvement, not a silent drift.

### Robustness (review-driven)

- **ndarray return no longer truncates folded tokens.** `simplify(np.array([...]))` re-infers the result
  string width (keeping the input dtype *kind*); previously a fold that emitted a token wider than the
  input tokens (e.g. `1/0 -> float("inf")` from a `<U1` input) was silently truncated. Affected both the
  Rust-routed and pure-Python paths.
- **Malformed / pathological input raises a clean `ValueError`** instead of an uncatchable abort. A
  malformed prefix (an operator with too few operands) and an excessively long expression
  (`> 4096` tokens, which would recurse deep enough to overflow the stack) are now rejected up front.
  Empty input is still valid (`simplify([]) == []`). Valid inputs are unaffected (verified: 0 diffs vs
  the pre-fix engine across 112,040 corpus comparisons).
- **`simplipy._core` load failures now warn** (`RuntimeWarning`) rather than silently degrading to the
  slower pure-Python path.
- The pow-chain exponent product is computed in `i128` (Python's `prod` is arbitrary-precision), pushing
  the divergence boundary past any reachable exponent.

### Notes

- **Offline mining now uses the Rust inline methods internally** (e.g. `find_rules` calls the improved
  `simplify`/conversions). For Phase-A this is intended; it does not re-mine or change shipped assets,
  but mining a *new* asset under 0.3 would inherit the numeric-line behavior.
- **Folding precision:** the f64 evaluator folds through the platform's system `libm` (not NumPy). On a
  given platform it is byte-identical between the Rust and the pure-Python fallback, but folded constants
  can differ **sub-ULP** from the previous NumPy-based folding. No bit-identity vs 0.2.x folded constants
  is promised (or expected).
- **Pure-Python fallback:** if the compiled `simplipy._core` extension is unavailable, the engine
  transparently falls back to pure-Python implementations (correct, slower). `import simplipy` never
  depends on the extension or on `ctypes`/`libm` being present.

### Build / packaging

- Build backend switched from setuptools to **maturin** (mixed layout: Python at `src/simplipy/`,
  Rust crate under `rust/`, compiled module `simplipy._core`). One abi3 wheel per platform/arch for
  CPython ≥ 3.11.
- **New runtime dependency:** `platformdirs` (resolves the per-user asset cache directory).
